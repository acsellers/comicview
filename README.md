# ComicView (get cool name later)

The Comic viewing applications on Ubuntu 18.04 aren't working for me.

So I'm writing, slowly, one that works for me. It's kind of basic and doesn't handle
all sorts of formats. It needs a refactor at some point, but at the moment it works.

No advanced features available.
