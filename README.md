# ComicView (get cool name later)

So, this is a (in development) gtk comic viewer for Linux OS's.

The Comic viewing applications on Ubuntu 18.04 aren't working for me.

So I'm writing, slowly, one that works for me. It's kind of basic and doesn't handle
all sorts of formats. It needs a refactor at some point, but at the moment it works.

No advanced features available.
